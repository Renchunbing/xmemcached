--------xmemcached 1.1.2-Released-----------
1.Supports integrating to spring framework.for example:

 <bean name="memcachedClient"
		class="net.rubyeye.xmemcached.utils.XMemcachedClientFactoryBean">
		<property name="servers">
			<value>localhost:12000 localhost:12001</value>
		</property>
 </bean>
Then you can use memcachedClient bean in other beans.More information is on wiki.

2.Support verbosity protocol.This protocol is used to set logging level for memcached logging output.
Add two methods to MemcachedClient,include:

setLoggingLevelVerbosity(InetSocketAddress address, int level)
setLoggingLevelVerbosityWithNoReply(InetSocketAddress address,int level)

3.Support weighted server.Now you can set the memcached servers in different weight.
The only change is the way to build XMemcachedClient:


MemcachedClientBuilder builder = new XMemcachedClientBuilder(AddrUtil.getAddresses("localhost:12000 localhost:12001"),new int[]{1,3});
builder.setSessionLocator(new KetamaMemcachedSessionLocator());
MemcachedClient memcachedClient=builder.build();

As you see,now you can pass a weight array to XMemcachedClientBuilder constructor.The array's length must be great or equal to address list size.

4.Support noreply for add,set,replace,cas,append,prepend,delete,incr/decr,flush_all,verbosity protocols.
Add some new methods in MemcachedClient,include:

setWithNoReply,addWithNoReply,replaceWithNoReply,appendWithNoReply,prependWithNoReply,casWithNoReply
deleteWithNoReply,incr(decr)WithNoReply,flushAllWithNoReply,setLoggingLevelVerbosityWithNoReply

5.bug fixed. Issue 35,Issue 36,Issue 37 etc.

6.Improve session monitor.When session is closed by exception or network error,
monitor will reconnect to the session until success.
The older version set the interval between reconnecting is 10 seconds,now set it to 0 seconds.

                     Deprecated                                                Instead
                     
    net.rubyeye.xmemcached.utils.AddrUtil.getAddress(String server) =====> getOneAddress(server)
    net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClient.version()                =====>  getVersions()       
    net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClientMemcachedClient.stats(String host, long timeout)

      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClientBuilder.setTranscoder      => Transcoder getter/setter
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClientBuilder.getTranscoder
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClient.getVersions()   => get all connected memcached servers's versions
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClient.getStats()      => get all connected memcached servers's stats.
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClient.getStatsByItem(String item)      => get all connected memcached servers's special item stats.
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClient.setOpTime()     => set the default operation timeout
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClient.getOpTime()     => get the default operation timeout
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.MemcachedClient.getAvaliableServers()  => Return avaliable servers
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.utils.AddrUtil.getOneAddress    => get a InetSocketAddress from string
6.Add some new classes.Includes
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.codec.MemcachedCodecFactory     => Implements yanf4j CodecFactory
                                   MemcachedDecoder
                                   MemcachedEncoder          => decode/encode commands
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.command.text.*
      net.rubyeye.xmemcached.command.*                       => Commmands implemented memcached text protocol   
7.Change CommandFactory from class to interface,TextCommandFactory implement it for creating text protocol based commands.
